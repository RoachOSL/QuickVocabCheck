QuickVocabCheck
QuickVocabCheck is a personal project designed to assist with language learning, specifically for improving English vocabulary. This lightweight application allows users to input words and their corresponding translations, building a custom dictionary. The core feature is a self-testing mechanism, where the app prompts the user with words from their dictionary, asking for the correct translations to reinforce learning.

Features
Custom Dictionary Creation: Input unfamiliar English words and their meanings to form your tailored dictionary.
Interactive Testing: Engage in self-quizzes where the app tests your recall of the words and their translations.
Progress Tracking: Monitor your learning progress over time as you consistently use the app.
This app is intended for those who wish to enhance their English vocabulary through active recall and spaced repetition. SimpleLearningDictionaryApp is your personal companion in language mastery, perfect for quick learning sessions during your daily commute or as part of a structured study routine.

Note: Currently, the app is tailored for personal use with a focus on functionality over form. Future updates may include a more refined UI, expanded language support, and integration with existing language learning frameworks.
